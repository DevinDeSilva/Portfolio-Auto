Welcome to Portfolio-Auto, your one-stop solution for effortless portfolio deployment with GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Streamlined Deployment:** Deploy your portfolio website hassle-free using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.

- **Online and Local Methods:** Choose between an online approach where you can simply commit and deploy or the local method with detailed instructions provided in our [wiki](https://github.com/nipdep/Portfolio-Auto/wiki).

- **CI/CD Automation:** Benefit from automated Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) with GitHub Actions. Your site gets built and deployed upon pushing to the `main` branch or creating a pull request to `main`.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get your portfolio up and running:

1. Commit your portfolio changes.

2. Check the deployment. It's that easy with our online approach!

Or, if you prefer working locally:

1. Create a pull request from `dev` to `main`.

2. Dive into our [wiki](https://github.com/nipdep/Portfolio-Auto/wiki) for comprehensive instructions on local deployment.

## Magic Behind the Scenes

Wondering how it all happens? We've got you covered:

- Your portfolio deployment is powered by GitHub Pages, and it's automated by GitHub Actions.

- Our `jekyll.yml` workflow in the `.github/workflows` directory handles both CI and CD.
