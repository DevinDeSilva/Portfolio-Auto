### the step by step guide
if you needed, and of course you need.

#### [step-1] get the code
> Unlike, usual `github` base development, here you don't even need to clone the repo. But, that may I said, you can do the same thing with good old github clone and push process, and this shall be the only way when you customize the themes.

> anyway, let's stop the high horse and go with the simplest path shall we
1. go the [portfolio-auto](https://github.com/nipdep/Portfolio-Auto) original repo, hope you are already there ðŸ˜‰
2. then `fork` the repo onto you personal github user account
   >> here `fork` process guarantee timely updates when the original __portfolio-auto__ repo get new features or themes
3. and, you are good to go to the next step

> BTW, if you are `pro` or one looking to customize themes
1. you can follow above `fork` based step as it said
2. plus, clone the __portfolio-auto__ repo in your personal github account, start work on local.

3. for the advance operation and local testing follow _github_ `Wiki` on [portfolio-auto](https://github.com/nipdep/Portfolio-Auto/wiki)

#### [step-2] Checkout your newly deployed portfolio
__What ??__
> Oh, yes. you have already deployed you portfolio. But, the little problem is there name is 'John Deo' and that guy is a figment of imagination.
<!-- SS- settings url of the page you -->

>> but, Why?
<!-- SS - yaml of workflow/SS of action -->

glad, you asked. __notice__ following section contains some serious CI/CD concepts. so let's get to it
the website deployment happens as a `github-page` and that process is automated by `github-action` more specifically, that repo `.github/workflows` directory contained `jekyll.yml` file see every action happens to the repo (__CI__)  and run jekyll site building and deployment (__CD__) on  `git push to main`, `git pull-request main`
So.. that what it take to deploy at a your commit, and now magic is gone.

#### [step-3] select your portfolio theme
> here theme are defined by branches of the github repo, specifically branches with name starting from `theme/<theme-name>`

__Preview__ 
> can be simply done just by looking at screen-shots in theme `readme` page 
> when you select the theme, then you open and _pull request_ from you selected theme branch to `dev` branch.

<!-- <img src="docs/HowTo/" alt=" "/> -->

#### [step-4] add your details
First, important file & folders to learn
1. `_config.yml` 
<img src="docs/HowTo/config_file.png" alt=" "/>

  > define your website configuration
  * website title
  * portfolio description
  * base-url, `"/Portfolio-Auto"` should be same as the your github repo name
  * contact information; phone, address
  * social media information; github, LinkedIn, Facebook, Slack, Instagram
  
2. `index.md`
<img src="docs/HowTo/index.md.png" alt=" "/>
   > root or the home page of your portfolio
   * nothing important from _content_ aspect
   * but the page layout should be in `home` 
3. `Gemfile` 
<img src="docs/HowTo/gemfile.png" alt=" "/>

   > jekyll website build file
   * again nothing much to change
4. `personal.md`
<img src="docs/HowTo/personal.md.png" alt=" "/>
   > your personal information summary 
   * all the information defined in the `_data/personal.yaml`
   * where you can add __description__, __fields_of_interest__, __soft_skills__, __certificates__
   * also, you can add key-value paired information in __details__
<img src="docs/HowTo/personalYmLnMD.png" alt=" "/>

5. routing pages, `projects.md`, `publications.md`, `experience.md`, `achievements.md`
   > these pages contains tag information, routings to all details posts
   * nothing to change
   <img src="docs/HowTo/posts_folder_structure.png" alt=" "/>

6. post pages, `_posts/*` all the `.md` files

   > detail of the post
   * all the posts should be in particular directory in `_posts` as  `post.type`
   * you just have only have to duplicate existing `.md` file under the same directory and change the _front-matter_ accordingly. i.e. except `layout`, `categories`, `type` and `permalink`
   * and `{% assign pub = site.data.publications.<project-name> %}` 
   <!-- SS<- as this is shown -->
   * all the post name should be in `data-nametag.md`, example: `2023-10-23-project_1.md`
   <img src="docs/HowTo/postPages.png" alt=" "/>

7. post data pages, `_data/*` all the `.yml` files
   <img src="docs/HowTo/yamlFolderStructure.png" alt=" "/>
   > files that contains all the details about you endeavors and only place you truly have to put effort into
   * all the posts should be in particular directory in `_data` as  `post.type`
   * if you are going with current information point in `.yml` files, just duplicate and set file name in `<project-name>.yml`, assuming there will be not duplicate project names found
   * then you just change the actual information under each key.
   * __we strongly recommend you not to add or change keys in those `.yml` files__
   * _for any conciliation you need to add information under new tag, you can do it but it has to taken care in related and all the other post files in `_posts` directory.
   * checkout _github_ `Wiki` on [portfolio-auto](https://github.com/nipdep/Portfolio-Auto/wiki) example of advance operations
   * __all the value names under `technologies` key in any `.yml` file should be in `assets/images/logos` in same name formatting

> if you following fully online way, you just have to push commit and check to deployment. 
<!-- SS to show commit in the github -->
> as a next step you could create a _pull request_ from `dev` to `main` branch.
> when you working on local and then follow [the wiki](https://github.com/nipdep/Portfolio-Auto/wiki)
