description: "In the challenging VIP22 competition, our mission was crystal clear: to distinguish synthetic AI-generated images from natural ones and identify the specific generative model used. This ambitious endeavor led us on a research odyssey through the intricate world of computer vision. From experimenting with generic Vision Transformer-based classifiers to harnessing the power of Contrastive Learning techniques, we left no stone unturned. We even ventured into the realm of adversarial learning models to sharpen our edge in this grand competition."
