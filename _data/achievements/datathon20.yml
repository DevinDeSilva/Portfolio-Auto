description: "Our participation in the All-Island Data Science and Machine Learning Competition was a journey of data exploration, innovation, and societal impact. In this thrilling competition, we embarked on a comprehensive data analysis quest that led to a groundbreaking solution. Our final challenge was to design a system for detecting Covid-19 spread and conducting a thorough analysis of its impact. We took a multifaceted approach, crafting an LSTM-based multivariate time series model for precise Covid-19 spread predictions at the district level. To provide valuable insights, we harnessed meta-heuristic analysis techniques to evaluate the potential impact of Covid-19 on various selected industries."
